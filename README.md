## About ObjectOrientedTestWithC-

I was just helping my GF with a programming homework on C# and this was the task. Write class Competitor and a class Team, which would contain a dynamic array of Competitors objects.

Just very barely I am familiar with C# and Visual Studio as well as any other IDEs (as a WEB developer most of the code is written in text editor). Nevertheless, I was very suprised with how functional and fast C# was during this exercies. I really liked the outcome and that is why I am sharing this code.
